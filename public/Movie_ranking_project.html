<h1>The Best Movies According To Cago</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Don't Fuck With Cats</h3>
<p>This is my favourite crime documentary. The plot is such interesting.</p>
<h3>The White Ribbon</h3>
<p>Ä°t can come boring and kinda constant to many people. But solving the mystery behind the scenes blows your mind. Think Haneke did a well job. </p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>The choose of actor for the lead cast is so sensible, Cillian Murphy is so suitible for the main cast. The movie makes you love physics and quatum mechanics.</p>
